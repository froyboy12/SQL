# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


# I found out which artist had more than 5 tracks under their name and listed them below.--
SELECT artist_name AS Artist
,track_name AS Track
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name LIKE '%LI%' AND track_name> 5
ORDER BY artist_name DESC;

# Then I find out the top 3 artists with the longest average song duration, in descending with longet average first?
SELECT artist_name AS Artist
,AVG(duration_ms/60000)AS Minutes 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY Artist 
ORDER BY Minutes DESC
LIMIT 3;

# I take it a step further determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

# Lastely I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name
,artist_name
,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;
