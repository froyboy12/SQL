#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data. 
#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) 
     SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles 
     WHERE type = 'Movie'; 
     
#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
     SELECT max(date(date_added)
     FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles;
     
#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
      SELECT title
      FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
      ORDER BY title asc; 
      
#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
      SELECT DISTINCT director
      FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
      LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech". "netflix_people" people
      ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
      WHERE titles.title='Bright Star'; 
      
#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
      SELECT title, release_year
      FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
      WHERE type = 'Movie'
      ORDER BY release_year ASC
      LIMIT 1; 

#6. Here I used a subquery to demonstrate that there's actually 2 of the oldest movies of the same year?
      SELECT title, release_year 
      FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
      WHERE type = 'Movie'
      AND release_year <= 
     (SELECT MIN(release_year) 
      FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
      WHERE type = 'Movie');
