--#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data--

--#1 How many orders were placed in January?-- 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)

--#2 How many of those orders were iphone?--
SELECT COUNT(orderid)

--#3  Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February?--
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

-- #4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January , and what was the price?--
--I have listed beneath 4 ways to solve this question--

--Question 4 Answer 1--
SELECT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

--Question 4 Answer 2--
SELECT product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product,price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--Question 4 Answer 3--
SELECT DISTINCT product, min(price)

--Question 4 Answer 4--
SELECT product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan

ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;
